# filename: titlecase.awk
#   author: Eric Pement - email: eric [dot] pement [at] moody [dot] edu
#  version: 1.22
#     date: 25 February 2004
# requires: GNU awk
#
# Purpose:
#   This is a function for taking a string in "ALL CAPS", "lowercase", or
#   "miXeD cAsE" and converting it to "Title Case", such as would be used
#   for book or chapter titles. It also works well for normalizing personal
#   names and street addresses. It keeps Roman numerals and special
#   abbreviations (like USA, LXX, NT, NY) in caps, but keeps articles,
#   conjunctions, and prepositions between words in lowercase. Names like
#   D'Arcy, O'Reilly, and McDonald are properly capitalized, as are
#   abbreviations like Ph.D. or D.Min. Obeys most style manual rules.
#
#   credit: This function was inspired by totitle.awk by M. Joshua Ryan,
#           which had a similar purpose but not enough exception handling.
#           I completely rewrote it, added debugging and other features.
#
# function: titlecase("CHANGE TO TITLE CASE") --> "Change to Title Case"
#
# Other Features:
#   titlecase() will compress whitespace if a second parameter is passed.
#   It is sufficient to use a positive number: titlecase(string,1)
#
#   Debugging/diagnostic output will be printed to stdout if "-v debug=1
#   is added as a command-line argument to gawk.
#
#   If reformatting a mailing list, add "-v state_abb=1" as a command-line
#   argument for 59 two-letter abbreviations accepted by the Postal Service.
#
#   This function tries to implement the "Title Case" constructs specified
#   in the APA Style Manual and the Chicago Manual of Style. Instead of
#   merely capitalizing the first letter of each word and setting
#   everything else in lowercase, this function implements the following
#   conditions:
#
#  - Conjunctions, articles, and prepositions are set lowercase, UNLESS they
#    are the first word of the string or the first word after a colon, a
#    question mark, or an exclamation point.
#  - Compass points (NE, SW, etc.) are set in solid caps.
#  - Roman numerals (II, IV, VII, IX, etc.) are set in solid caps.
#  - Certain abbreviations are always capitalized (AIDS, ASCII, NT, USA, etc.)
#  - Names beginning with D' or O' are set as D'Arcy, O'Reilly, etc.
#  - Hyphenated strings receive internal caps (Smith-Williams, Twenty-Two)
#  - Contractions such as I'll, You've, Don't, etc. are handled properly
#  - Degrees such as Ph.D., M.Div., etc. are properly capitalized
#
# Sample Usage with GNU awk (gawk):
#
#   (1) Simple use. To change each line of "infile" and redirect the result
#   to "outfile", do this:
#
#   awk -f titlecase.awk -W source="{print titlecase($0)}" infile >outfile
#
#   (2) Complex use. To alter particular fields or substrings, use a
#   separate awk script. Below is a sample of using 2 scripts from a
#   command prompt under Microsoft Windows:
#
#   --------------------------------------------------------------
#   [c:\tmp]type infile
#   JOHN DOE,123 MAIN ST.,CHICAGO,IL,12345
#   OLD MACDONALD,456 FARM HWY.,PEORIA,IL,23456
#   TIM O'REILLY,P.O. BOX 789,LOS ANGELES,CA,34567
#
#   [c:\tmp]type myfile.awk
#   {
#      # Set the input field separator on the command line!
#      OFS = ","            # Set the output field separator
#      $1 = titlecase($1)   # Format the 1st field and
#      $2 = titlecase($2)   #   the 2nd field also.
#      print                # Print the revised line.
#   }
#
#   [c:\tmp]awk -F"," -f titlecase.awk -f myfile.awk infile

#
# CHANGELOG:
# 1.22 - Added a new switch to accept all 2-letter abbreviations of US States
#   and territories. Added "nor" to conjunctions; DVD, FM and TV to other.
#   More remarks throughout for new awk users.
# 1.21 - explicitly declared a field separator for split() function
